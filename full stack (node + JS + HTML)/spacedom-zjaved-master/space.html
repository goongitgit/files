            There are more stars in our universe than grains of sand in all of Earth's deserts
            and on all of its beaches. There are more than 200 billion stars in the Milky
            Way galaxy alone, 10% of which are similar to the Sun. Nearly a fifth of those
            Sun-like stars have an Earth-sized plant in the "habitable zone", meaning there are
            an estimated 4 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy. That number balloons to
            40 billion if you include planets orbiting red dwarfs. The closest one? That would
            be Proxima Centauri b, which orbits the closest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri,
            a mere 4.2 light-years away. If you were traveling at the speed of the
            fastest-moving manmade object (the Parker Solar Probe), an amazing 68.6 km/s,
            it would still take 18,500 years to get there. So close, yet so far.

          <h3>Mars Rovers by Year</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Over the past several decades, a couple countries (mainly the US)
            have sent different rovers into space to learn more about Mars. The
            following list contains some of the successful launches and landings
            of Mars rovers:

            <h3>What We've Learned About Mars So Far:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>The Martian landscape may have been shaped by megafloods</li>
              <li><em>Mars still has multiple bodies of liquid water</em></li>
              <li>It has auroras</li>
              <li>Mars has two tiny moons, Phobos and Deimos. These moons rotate
                almost in the same plane as the Red Planets equator, which means
                the moons likely formed at the same time as Mars.
              </li>
              <li>It had a system of <em>giant rivers</em> that lasted billions of years</li>
              <li>The sedimentary rocks record layers of history</li>
            </ol>
